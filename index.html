							<article id="interest">
								<h2 class="major">My Interest in IT</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Tom.jpg" alt="When i look at coding." /></span>
								<p>Well, had my first 'interested peak' during my diploma in engineering, the course consists of language C and C++ as their basic programming even though the lecturer was not that great at teaching, I still had my fun. After completing my diploma, I went back to Malaysia and that is where I got my 'second peak' due to influential surroundings such as my cousin who is expertised in IT and also happens to be one of the person that I have upmost respect for, and friends that study in IT as they would show me how coding and programming would work and help out in real life. Apart from that, it was also partially due to online friends that could code and implement into online game to 'make life easier'. </p>
								<p><u>As why I would choose RMIT</u> is because of friends who studied in RMIT had recommended to me to it due to its phenomenal expertisement in IT related programs while also providing students major pratical participation in coding, app developing and other units that would help out in modern business and industries. That aside, RMIT is walking distance from where I stay which is unsurprisingly convenient. </p>
								<p><u>For stuffs that I would expect to learn during my course of IT</u> are things that I had learned about since week 1 as this is my very first step in the world of IT, I could not expect more but surprises await me in the upcoming week where I would be introduced to new codes and other IT units that I had never learn before.</p>

						<!-- Ideal Job -->
							<article id="job">
								<h2 class="major">Ideal job</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Trimstam.jpg" alt="Concept artwork of Diablo 3" /></span>
								<p>That would be part of the Blizzard Entertainment game developer as they created many triple A entitled games such as the Diablo series and the Warcraft series. Both series are driven by obscure stories and outstanding combat systems as well as real time strategy, something I would absolutely binge for. I find that being a system engineer is appealing to me as they allow me to provide ideas contributing to be part of a grand project as well as researching newer technologies that include both softwarea and hardware in order to up the limit of what we currently able to used, it is something I enjoy and feel happy as being part of the team.</p>
								<p><u>As for the job requirements</u> for that particular spot, is to have a degree in Computer Science or relatad field, able to use varieties of programming languages to their fullest extents as well as the responsibilities and abilities to contribute to the grand aspects of the projects. That being said, I only have minimal knowledge for Java as this is my first year in IT as well as minimal knowledge in Language C/C++ as I had obtained in the past diploma.</p>
								<p><u>While working towards my goal,</u> I will have to study and practise extra hard in order to gain mastery over programming languages as well as obtaining underlying experiences through workshops, internships if possible or even participate in anything related to my goals in order to enhance my experiences within the field. </p>

								<h4 class="major">In Conclusion</h4>
								<p>All of the above test results are surprisingly accurate to me just as I would describe myself. Avoiding responsiblities, not out-spoken and impatience are probably the biggest issue for me and it is something I definitely have to change as it could prove fatal mistakes for groupworks and even my life. Apart from that, while in a group dicussion or brainstorming session, I would think outside the box and grind my brain to the max just to squeeze out more questions for my groupmates to look at while trying to think of a solution for that particular problem or question and work with my team to solve it together. In addtion to that, I would agreed on most of the suggestions as this would keeps the morale going while trying to analayse if there are any potential issues to that suggestions.</p>

						<!-- Project Ideas -->
							<article id="project">
								<h2 class="major">My Project Idea</h2>
								<h3 class="major"><i>Overview</i></h3>
								<p>While letting my mind wander off into space, I came out with an idea for an action role-playing styled hack-and-slash game that offers varieties of mechanics that would shape and make impact as you progress deeper into the game. Gameplay wise would be similar to that of Diablo series with a top down perspective as well as real-time action combat mechanics that based on reflexes but instead of fixed classes, you will need to make and shape your own class. Being cooperative with other players are strongly recommended for this game as oppose of being a lone wolf due to in game mechanics where strenghts and weaknesses being the core. </p>
								<h3 class="major"><i>Motivation</i></h3>
								<p>Being an introvert, I would spend most of my time enclosing myself in my own room and play games. The more i play, the motivations to create my own game is becoming clearer and clearer as time flies by. The idea behind this game is originated from action RPG games, such as Diablo series, Path of Exile as well the infamous money grabber, MU Legend. They are all good and fun games from my perspectives but then everytime they try to balance the game, they would just make it worse. All good things come to an end when they introduced bunch of micro-transaction thing where it would straight up increase the gap between real money spenders and free to play players.</p>
								<h3 class="major"><i>Description</i></h3>
								<p>In contrast to most RPG games that go with the flow of 'balance', this game goes with imbalance being the 'balance' in the game as you would need to coop with other players in order to finish a specific dungeon. The catch here being the strengths or weaknesses of how you had shaped your character, being too superior in something and u would lose out some aspects while being a jack of all trade would impede progressions as you would have masteries over none thus making game even harder. Cooperative is strongly encouraging rather than being a lone wolf as I would believe the quote 'Teamwork makes dream work' and just like in real life, as a team, you would need someone to cover up parts where you absolutely have no experience for in order to progress further. 
									In this game, you cannot buy your ways through the game as there would not be any sort of boosts but instead purely for cosmetics, 
									people can trade items via in game currencies that they would have to grind for as well as trade from the most basic tier 1 currency all 
									the way up to rare tier 10 currency that they could either be used to empower your characters through meaning of fortifying gears or 
									permanent attributes boost or trade with other players for more powerful equipments. Apart from that, the game do have housing 
									features as well so you could build and design your own house however the way you like, this provides a breathing room for players 
									who are sick of grinding as well as for players that enjoy more of a peaceful way to play the game, but nothing comes free in the game, 
									you will have to collect materials in open world in order to build. That being said, for higher levelled players, occasional invasions 
									would occurs when a certain event triggers during progressions or a random time which the chance of happening would get higher the longer 
									the time span as well as during in game progressions, players will have affiliation meters 
									that determines if you are evil or lawful which is increased or decreased by the choices u made when interacting with 
									the environment as well as non-player characters, joining certain associations would also results in being a nemesis or ally to another 
									associations which is also connected to the frequency of being invaded. Players will have to defend their homeland or risk being reduced
									to ashes, the catch is that the invasions could happen anytime even when the players have logged off and 
								this is where cooperation comes to play, a signal will be sent to every allied associations or befriended players notify them your homeland being invaded, successful defending an invasion would offers rewards based on the participants.
							Last but not least, the game features bunch of minigames as well such as fishing, mining, hunting etc that players can gain masteries from and depending on the strengths of your character, you would
							 gain certain mastery faster than others. Minigame masteries would contribute to progression as well such a being a wood cutting master would let you slay an ent easier than others since you know everything about trees. </p>
								<h3 class="major"><i>Tools and Technology requirements</i></h3>
								<p>In order to create such a massive scale and complex game would requires a much more advanced game engine such as Unity being the most basic one or Unreal Engine 4 being the more advanced tool. Language requirement for both engines are C++, C# or JavaScript which are all part of the current course that i could gain masteries over. 
									Both game engines could generate breathe-taking graphics as well as the immersions as if you are in the game yourself while Unity
									graphics not as stunning as Unreal Engine 4, it would serves as a bedrock for my game, allows me to learn as well as experiments on, contributing as a whole.
								 </p>
								 <h3 class="major"><i>Skill Requirements</i></h3>
								 <p>To create such an ambitious game would requires experts with extensive knowlegde for languge C++, C# and JavaScript as mentioned above, graphic designers and Artificial Intelligence experts as well any sort of experts in a related field that could contribute to the project, and such are the more realistic and reasonable assets required for it and That
									 would requires a really deep pocket in order to support the cause which in return the outcomes would probably not as good as it would visualized. Thus, remains an idea for now which could be revamped into something that much more grand than the current state it is.  </p>
								<h3 class="major"><i>The Outcome</i></h3>
								<p>If this project would somehow be successful, I would believe that this would quickly spread all over the world as this is a major breakthrough for the current state for most game. You cannot buy your way to win and everything has to be hard earned in order to come out victorious. So far every game developers are slowly turning into hungry coyotes that do not 
									seek for meat but for money as monetization is becoming more and more common among every games while making games with little to no efforts. This clearly breaks the heart of loyal fanbases but they would continue providing supports even though they clearly know the game developers they once loved and have upmost respect for are no longer existed anywhere.
								I hope this would reignite the passion for most game developers and bring them back to once where they belong, game filled with passions and hardworks they had poured countless of hours into. </p>
